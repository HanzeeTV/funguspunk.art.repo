My name Is Ivory but you may only call me MY warrior name FungusPunk. I collect others garbage and make it into STYLISH garbage. Now a question for you... Do y'all like draping your neked body in cool threads? Do you like to make a statement with your hot bod? "shhh don't answer that". Well do I got the thing for you! Weekly drops of handmade clothing and jewelry. They are my treasures BUUUUT I am willing to trade them for coin???? Pss... disclaimer ( belly button lint may be lost in the process if you wish for it back then no its theirs now) Good luck!  
  
I have been making clothing since I was twelve. I started with a sewing machine at my grandma's who helped me make a costume for Halloween. There I learner I had the skill to alter and sew clothes. I grew up in a lower class home in middle of buttfuck nowhere Utah were I did everything to make my older brothers clothes into MY clothes. Non of it really fit but I will always cherish the day he passed down his colorful acid wash jeans from Hot Topic. that's the day he became a Skater and I became a punk. One day walking eight miles to school because I missed the bus I found a blank CD on the side of the road and brought it home. On that CD was system of a down but Green Day was the music I fell in love with on the radio. When the first old brick of a computer entered my house I found myself researching punk music and I stumbled upon the culture around it. I could not agree more with the morals and politics of it all so I joined. So back to the acid wash jeans, I had an opportunity to make anything I wanted and I made my first pair of crust pants. So I did and I never lost that itch to alter and make more after that. Now I am sharing that love for handy down clothes with all of you. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do.
