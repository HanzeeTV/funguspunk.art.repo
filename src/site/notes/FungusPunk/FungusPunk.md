![TickPatch01.png|323x265](/img/user/FungusPunk/Images/TickPatch01.png)I have been making clothing since I was twelve. I started with a sewing machine at my grandma's who helped me make a costume for Halloween. There I learner I had the skill to alter and sew clothes. I grew up in a lower class home in middle of buttfuck nowhere Utah were I did everything to make my older brothers clothes into MY clothes. Non of it really fit but I will always cherish the day he passed down his colorful acid wash jeans from Hot Topic. that's the day he became a Skater and I became a punk. One day walking eight miles to school because I missed the bus I found a blank CD on the side of the road and brought it home. On that CD was system of a down but Green Day was the music I fell in love with on the radio. When the first old brick of a computer entered my house I found myself researching punk music and I stumbled upon the culture around it. I could not agree more with the morals and politics of it all so I joined. So back to the acid wash jeans, I had an opportunity to make anything I wanted and I made my first pair of crust pants. So I did and I never lost that itch to alter and make more after that. Now I am sharing that love for handy down clothes with all of you. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do.

Here is where all you beautiful bodies and ghouls shall contact me. Ask me for customer work? Yes. Ask me for jewelry? Yes. Ask me were to send coin for trade? We will figure that out later when we talk. I make custom upcycled clothes. Send me in an item of clothing you want altered and tell me about the things you love in life. Then I can make you a piece customized around you and your experience...Or give me free range to fuck your shit up, that's good too. If there is any pre made items you like let me know and I can put them on hold and work on shipping them out to you.
